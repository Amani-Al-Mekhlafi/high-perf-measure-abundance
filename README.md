This Shiny App computes to give the users the accessibility to judge whether a pilot study contains good biomarkers and is worthy to be extended with larger sample size using different performance methods. 
Due to the affordability to study large number of biomarker candidates to find a good biomarker to diagnose or predict the target. However, because of the high cost and long time to collect and prepare the data in this type of study, researchers prefer to check the potential of the large set of biomarker candidates in a small pilot study. Users can compare the number of biomarker candidates with a better value than the given value to the corresponding number in the random dataset. If there are significantly more such biomarkers in the real dataset of the pilot study than in the random dataset, even if they lose their significance after the multiple testing, it might be worthwhile to extend the study.
